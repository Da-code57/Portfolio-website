    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
   I'm Daniellah, a computer science undergraduate specializing in web development.  
With a growing passion for technology and problem-solving, I'm focused on mastering the full-stack development process — from frontend design to backend logic.  

I'm currently working on personal projects to build my portfolio and continuously improve my skills in modern web technologies.

     <p>
      This is my very first project- a personal portfolio website I built using HTML and CSS.
      It's designed to showcase who I am, my skills, and the projects I'll create as I continue learning web development
      </p>
      <p>I plan to continuously improve it as I gain more experience and start adding future projects built with Javascript, React, and other technologies.</p>
